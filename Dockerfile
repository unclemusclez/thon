# THON - The Hackathon Organizer Node Sandbox Image
# This Dockerfile builds a sandbox image with code-server pre-installed
# for multi-instance VS Code remote hackathon environments.
#
# HTTPS Support:
#   - By default, code-server runs over HTTP
#   - For HTTPS, mount certificates and use: code-server --cert /certs/server.pem --cert-key /certs/server-key.pem
#   - mkcert certificates can be generated on host and mounted into container
